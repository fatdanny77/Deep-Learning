Today I've installed anaconda since most people recommend it as a good enviornment of data science.  
I've learned how to create a new simple neaural network with Keras and train it with SGD(stochastic gradient descent,動態梯度下降法)  
Also, there's an interesting interactional tool in jupyter notebook called "interact_manual". It shows at the bottom of my code.
